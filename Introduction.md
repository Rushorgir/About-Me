Just joined GitHub, so a quick introduction:
- 👋 Hi, I’m @Rushorgir
- 👀 I’m interested in Tech and Food.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a few languages, JAVA and CSS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing. I'm a lone wolf.
- 📫 Reach me on discord: Rushorgir#5072

Just the default GitHub introduction, not so interesting :)
